BASSNet doesn't look so expensive, now I look. Was there always cheap shareware option?

- Shareware license: 29.00 EuroAllows the usage of BASS.NET in an unlimited number of your shareware products, which must sell for no more than 40 Euros each. If you're an individual (not a corporation) making and selling your own software (and its price is within the limit), this is the licence for you.
- Single Commercial license: 199.00 EuroAllows the usage of BASS.NET in a single commercial product. If you are a company making and selling your own software (and use BASS.NET only in a single product), this is the licence for you.
- Unlimited Commercial license: 499.00 EuroAllows the usage of BASS.NET in an unlimited number of your commercial products. This licence is on a per site basis. So if your company has two sites that use BASS.NET, then two licences are required.
