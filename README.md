Attempted a branch to switch to using [Managed Bass](https://github.com/ManagedBass/ManagedBass) (free) instead of [BASS.NET](http://bass.radio42.com/help/#) (free for non-comercial only).

As of Unity 2017.0.1p2, It targets a higher version of the NET framework than Unity supports though, and so cannot be used.

Unity also conflicts with Nuget in a way I couldn't be arsed to figure out.
